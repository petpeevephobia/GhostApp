# GhostApp
Terminal-based Python WhatsApp bot, that auto-responds to new messages on WhatsApp desktop.

The program allows the cursor to rest on any of your old WhatsApp messages on default. When WhatsApp receives a new message, the program will search for the user who sent it and open the new message. It will locate the message bubble, receive the input and respond accordingly. All this takes place without intervention.

1. Run 'main.py'
2. Allow the program to control your cursor.
3. To end the process, press Ctrl + C on the terminal.
